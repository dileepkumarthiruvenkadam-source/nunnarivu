Here is the realistic and optimized roadmap for you to build everything solo until an investor-ready demo, with 8 hours/day of focused work.

This plan assumes:
	•	You have me assisting you on every technical step
	•	You do all implementation yourself
	•	Goal: AI hardware + OS-layer demo (the Nunnarivu concept)
	•	Demo means:
✔ A small accelerator on FPGA
✔ A basic Linux driver
✔ A working AI OS layer prototype
✔ A simple app automation “agent”

You DO NOT need ASIC or a full GPU for an investor demo.

⭐ NUNNARIVU SOLO ROADMAP — 120 DAYS (4 MONTHS TOTAL)

(8 hours/day, with me as your technical mentor)

⸻

📍 PHASE 1 — Fundamentals + Toolchain Setup (Days 1–14)

Goal: Become competent in hardware + OS foundations

What you will do:
	•	Learn Verilog basics
	•	Install Verilog tools (Icarus/Verilator + GTKWave)
	•	Learn FPGA basics
	•	Learn Linux kernel module basics
	•	Setup your dev environment + GitHub

Daily Output:
	•	LED blink on simulated FPGA
	•	First “Hello kernel driver” in Linux

🔋 End of Phase Deliverable:
Your machine can simulate hardware + run kernel modules.

⸻

📍 PHASE 2 — Build Your First Compute Tile (Days 15–35)

Goal: Make a working MAC “accelerator block”

You will build:
	•	16-bit MAC unit
	•	Vectorized MAC unit
	•	Pipelined version
	•	Testbenches
	•	Waveform verification
	•	FPGA synthesis

What you learn:
	•	Parallel compute
	•	Pipelining
	•	RTL debugging
	•	How a GPU core is built at smallest level

🔋 End of Phase Deliverable:
Working accelerator tile running on FPGA simulation.

⸻

📍 PHASE 3 — FPGA Hardware Bring-Up (Days 36–55)

Goal: Run your compute tile on actual hardware

You will:
	•	Buy FPGA dev board (€100–€200)
	•	Upload bitstream
	•	Connect UART or USB
	•	Feed data into your MAC unit
	•	Receive output on PC
	•	Verify hardware matches simulation

Milestone:
The MAC engine works physically on FPGA.

🔋 End of Phase Deliverable:
Your first working hardware accelerator.

Investors LOVE this.

⸻

📍 PHASE 4 — Linux Driver + API (Days 56–75)

Goal: Make the accelerator usable from OS

You will create:
	•	A Linux kernel module
	•	A /dev/nunnarivu_acc0 device
	•	IOCTL or write() calls
	•	Memory-mapped I/O (fake or simple at first)
	•	A C/Python library to call the driver

This looks like:

from nunnarivu import Accelerator
acc = Accelerator()
result = acc.mac_vector(A, B)

🔋 End of Phase Deliverable:
Real driver + API that lets software call your hardware.

This is the INVESTOR DEMO CORE.

⸻

📍 PHASE 5 — “Nunnarivu OS Layer” Prototype (Days 76–95)

Goal: Build the AI OS automation layer

You will build:
	•	A simple Python-based OS layer
	•	A system control agent
	•	App automation (MacOS Accessiblity API / pyobjc or AHK on Windows)
	•	Natural-language interface
	•	Integration with your hardware accelerator
→ even if only used for small operations

Example:

User: “Open Notion and create a new page titled ‘AI Roadmap’.”
Nunnarivu Layer: Automates it.

🔋 End of Phase Deliverable:
A working AI OS agent powered by your hardware tile.

⸻

📍 PHASE 6 — Full Demo Assembly (Days 96–110)

Goal: Combine the hardware, driver, and OS layer

Your demo will show:
	1.	Hardware accelerator tile on FPGA
	2.	OS layer agent controlling apps
	3.	Requests going → driver → hardware tile
	4.	Results used in real automation

This is enough for:

✔ AI accelerators
✔ AI OS layer
✔ A hardware-software co-design
✔ Real pipeline
✔ Working prototype

(Congrats: you can now pitch real deep-tech investors.)

⸻

📍 PHASE 7 — Investor Pitch + Documentation (Days 111–120)

You prepare:
	•	10-slide pitch deck
	•	Architecture diagram
	•	Roadmap
	•	Cost plan
	•	Hiring plan
	•	Market narrative
	•	Demo video

I help you write all of this.

🔋 Final Deliverable:
Investor-ready startup with working hardware + OS demo.

⸻

⭐ SUMMARY — SOLO TIMELINE (8 hours/day)

Phase	Days	Outcome
Fundamentals	1–14	tooling + basics
Compute Tile	15–35	hardware block sim
FPGA Bring-up	36–55	hardware works
Linux Driver	56–75	OS interface
Nunnarivu OS Layer	76–95	AI agent
Assemble Demo	96–110	full working demo
Pitch Prep	111–120	ready to raise funding


⸻

⭐ TOTAL TIME: 4 months

You can demo to investors in 120 days working solo — with me guiding you.

⸻

If you want, I will now create:

✔ Daily schedule (120 days)
✔ Tools + hardware list (budget under €300)
✔ Folder structure for the whole project
✔ GitHub repo plan
✔ Architecture diagrams

Just tell me:

👉 “Yes, make my full 120-day schedule.”
